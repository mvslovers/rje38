              RJE80 - A 3780 Emulator for Hercules/370/390
              ============================================


             Preliminary Documentation for the Beta release




What is RJE80?
--------------

It's a program that emulates an IBM 3780 RJE Terminal over a simulated
bisync line connected to the Hercules/370/390 Emulator.  If that made
perfect sense to you, skip on to the next section.  Otherwise, I'll explain
it all now.

RJE stands for Remote Job Entry, a protocol for transferring files to an
IBM mainframe, and receiving files in return.  Normally, but not necessarily,
these files take the form of 80 column "card decks" going to the mainframe,
and "printed output" coming back to the terminal.  The original intent and 
the most common use is to submit JCL to a mainframe operating system such 
as MVS or DOS/VS, and to receive the results of the job.

The IBM 3780 was the second in a line of RJE terminals IBM designed to implement
"clients" for the system.  The 3780 is the most commonly emulated terminal
in the commercial world, so I choose to emulate it.  The others, the 2780,
2770, 3770, and 3741 are different in hardware but almost (not quite!) the 
same in their capabilities and how they interact with the host system.

The Hercules emulator is a software program that runs under Microsoft Windows
and Linux on modern PC hardware, which emulates an IBM mainframe of the
System/370 class.  One of the devices that Hercules emulates is a IBM 2703
Bisync interface.

RJE uses as its communciations medium an IBM protocol known as bisync,
which stands for Binary Synchonous Communications.  Ordinarily, in the real
world bisync uses special interfaces and modems to connection two machines.
RJE80 does not use real bisync hardware like this, instead it pretends to
be sending data over a bisync link but really it uses a TCP/IP socket 
connection that is compatible with the Hercules implementation of the 
2703.  What this all means is that a mainframe operating system running
under Hercules that is configured to use a 2703 for RJE can talk to RJE80
and it will think it's a 3780.

The bottom line is, once you have your Hercules emulated System/370 configured,
and your mainframe operating system sysgenned to talk to the 2703 lines, RJE80
will submit jobs and receive printouts and punched card decks.



Configuring Hercules
--------------------

Note:  To use RJE80 with Hercules, you need version 3.01 or above.  The
2703 emulation is broken in earlier releases.

Configuring Bisync lines is easy.  For each line you want to use, put a 
line in your Hercules configuration file:

0070 2703 dial=IN lhost=my.hostname.com lport=3780

This line places a 2703 compatible bisync line at device 0070.  You need
to supply the internet name or IP address in the lhost parameter, and
the port that Hercules will use to listen for incoming "calls" from RJE80
in the lport parameter.  If you are only going to use RJE80 to connect 
to Hercules running on the same machine, use 127.0.0.1 as the lhost.
The lport is your choice, but it should be above 1000 and each separate
bisync line requires its own unique port.



Configuring the Host Operating System
-------------------------------------

This is a broad topic, only part of which is understood by me at this
point in time.  I have tested RJE80 with VM/370 and DOS/VS, so I will
discuss those two.  More information will follow as I figure out how
to configure RJE under OS/360, MVS, and OS/VS1.

VM/370
------

VM/370 has a subsystem called RSCS which supports the 3780 RJE terminal.
RSCS does not do RJE proper, in that it's not devoted to accepting jobs
and processing them.  VM/370 is not a batch system (there is CMSBATCH
which is a topic we don't cover here).  Instead, RSCS is mostly a system
for transferring files.  RJE80 can connect to an RSCS link and send files
to VM users and receive print files and punch files sent from other users.

YOu need to first change your VM/370 sysgen to include the bisync lines,
then configure RSCS for the lines you want to define.  To change your
sysgen, insert these two lines into DMKRIO ASSEMBLE

         RDEVICE ADDRESS=(070,16),DEVTYPE=2703,ADAPTER=BSCA 
         RCTLUNIT ADDRESS=070,CUTYPE=2703,FEATURE=16-DEVICE 

The RDEVICE should go into the RDEVICE section, and the RCTLUNIT in that
section of course.

To configure and regnerate RSCS, you need to modify 3 files.  Logon as
RSCS and modify them with EDIT.  This is my AXSLINKS COPY

 GENLINK ID=VMSYSUN,TYPE=DMTSML
 GENLINK ID=LINE1,TYPE=DMTNPT,KEEP=5,LINE=0B1,TASK=M1
 GENLINK ID=LINE2,TYPE=DMTNPT,KEEP=5,LINE=0B2,TASK=M2
 GENLINK
 GENLINK
 GENLINK
 GENLINK
 GENLINK

This is my LAXLINES COPY

 GENLINE LINE=0B1
 GENLINE LINE=0B2
 GENLINE LINE=0B3

This is my TAGQUEUE COPY

 GENTAGQ NUM=64

I use an EXEC I call RSCSGEN EXEC to regenerate RSCS automatically.
This is it:

ERASE DMTLOC MACLIB
MACLIB GEN DMTLOC AXSLINKS LAXLINES TAGQUEUE
EXEC VMFASM DMTSYS DMTR60
CP CLOSE RDR
CP PURGE RDR
CP CLOSE PUN
CP PURGE PUN
CP SPOOL PUN TO * CLASS A
CP SPOOL PRT FOR * CLOSE
VMFLOAD DMTLOAD DMTR60
CP CLOSE RDR
CP SPOOL PUN OFF
CP IPL C CLEAR

When you run this, you'll be asked 4 questions, like this:

DMTINI407R REWRITE THE NUCLEUS ?
yes
DMTINI408R IPL DEVICE ADDRESS =
191
DMTINI409R NUCLEUS CYL ADDRESS = 
4
DMTINI410R ALSO IPL CYLINDER 0 ? 
yes

RSCS will start up.  Later, when you logon to RSCS, you should
do so with the NOIPL option:  LOGON RSCS RSCS NO
Then when it's waiting, enter IPL 191 to start RSCS.  When RSCS
is READY, you need to start the lines:

START LINE1
START LINE2

VM/370 is now waiting for a call from RJE80.





DOS/VS
------

DOS/VS supports the 3780 for RJE quite nicely.  It does so through its
spooling subsystem POWER/VS.  You'll need to run a job to configure your
bisync lines and remote terminals for POWER/VS.  This is all covered in
detail in the POWER/VS installation and reference guide, starting on page
34.  It will be a two-step process.  First, you'll need to modify your
DOS/VS sysgen to include the bisync lines, then you'll need to define 
them to POWER/VS by regenning it.

I define 1 bisync line at device 070.  Put this statement in the
right place (numeric order by device address) in your sysgen deck and 
run a sysgen:

         DVCGEN CHUN=X'070',DVCTYP=2703


For the POWER/VS gen, insert these definitions after the POWER macro:

         PLINE ADDR=X'070',TRNSP=YES,CODE=EBCDIC,PSWRD=PASSWORD,       X
               TIMEOUT=NO,SWITCH=NO,MODSET=AA
         PRMT  REMOTE=1,TYPE=3780,PUNROUT=1,LSTROUT=1,LIST=132


Once you have run your sysgen, re-ipled with the new supervisor, 
then regenned POWER/VS and start it up, you should be able to use
this command to enable the line:

S RJE,X'070',PASSWORD

DOS/VS is now ready for a call from RJE80.




Using RJE80
-----------

RJE80 will run under Windows or Linux.  It works identically on
both.  It's a command-line driven program, sort of inspired by the
familiar interface of the Unix FTP program.

We'll practice by connecting to DOS/VS.

The first thing I do is expand my window to show 132 columns 
across, and expand its history buffer to the max.  I use a command
window under Windows and Konsole under linux.  Most every terminal
emulator will give you those choices.

To use RJE80, you need to tell it three things.  The first is the
address and port to connect to, the second is what host OS you're
interfacing with, and the last is the line ID and password for the
line you're using.  This takes three commands after you start the
program:

C:\>RJE80
) OPEN my.hostname.com 3780
RJE203I Link established to my.hostname.com (127.0.0.1)  port 3780.
) SET DOS
) SIGNON 1 PASSWORD
)

1R15I REMOTE 001 SIGNED ON ON 070

)

Now, if all went well, RJE80 is ready to work for you.  The message
1R15I came from DOS itself, sent over the line to your printer. This
is a pretty good sign that things are working!  However...if all 
didn't go well, the SIGNON hangs up waiting, or gets an error
message.  This means either the host isn't up, or the communications
with the host is failing.  Check your hostname, address, port number,
be sure Hercuels is running, DOS/VS us running, and the line is
enabled from DOS.

The SIGNON 1 PASSWORD logs us on to DOS...POWER/VS expects the
username to match the line number you are using, and PASSWORD is what
we set in the S RJE,X'070,PASSWORD command on the DOS operator's console.  

To send it a card deck, let's say for example one called lvtoc.jcl,
do this:

) SEND lvtoc.jcl
RJE173I Sending file 'lvtoc.jcl' to the host.
RJE181I 9 Total records sent.
)

Now wait a bit.  Hmmm, nothing seems to be happening.  Thats because
while DOS (hopefully) ran the job in lvtoc.jcl, its writer isn't
started.  We can actually check it out from our RJE terminal. We'll
use the CMD command:

) C D LST

1R46I    LIST QUEUE   P D C FROM TO  PAGES CC FORM
1R46I  LVTOC    00018 3 D A 001 001      3  1 1PT6

We sent a "D LST" command to DOS, it showed us our LST queue ... and
sure enough, there's our LVTOC output waiting.  What's wrong is the
rje writer isn't started.  We can start it, and tell it to go, like
this:

) CMD S LST
) CMD G LST

Now, the output from lvtoc.jcl scrolls out to your screen.  From here
on you don't have to Start and Go the LST writer.  SEND lvtoc.jcl again,
and after a delay you'll see its output appear automatically, unless
it needs a different FORM type, it which case, as the operator for 
this RJE line you'll need to do a G LST just like the DOS main operator
does when forms change.

RJE80 has features to make life a little easier for you.  Some are:

* You can put the host and port on the command line: 
         C:\>RJE80 my.host.com 3780
* You can put startup commands in a file rje80.rc
* Commands are not case sensitive.
* all commands can be abbreviated.
* Pretty extensive online help.  use HELP or ? at the command line.



Transferring files to and from RSCS
-----------------------------------

C:\>rje80 vm370.mydomain.com 3780
) SET VM
) SI LINE1

DMTNPT905I SIGNON OF LINK LINE1 COMPLETE

)

To send a file is easy enough, but before we do we need to indicate to which
VM user the file will be sent.

) SET USER MAINT
) SEND whatever.txt

To receive a file, you need to send it from another VM user.  Let's say we
want to send a copy of the directory VM50 DIRECT from MAINT to our RJE80.
Logon as MAINT, and set up to send a printout:

LOGON MAINT CPCMS
TAG DEV PRT LINE1
SPOOL PRT TO RSCS
PRINT VM50 DIRECT

You'll see RSCS tell MAINT that the file is accepted, then if you look at
the RSCS console you'll see it's sending the file (it's not instant, RSCS
waits a bit).  Then you'll see it appear on your RJE80 screen.  If you
want to save it and see it, use the PRINT command:

) PRINT PRINTFILE.TXT

If you don't want to display it onscreen:

) SET NOCOPY

Sending punch data is very similar.  To send a copy of VM50 DIRECT to the
3780's punch device:

TAG DEV PUN LINE1
SP PUN TO RSCS
PUNCH VM50 DIRECT

RJE80 doesn't show punch data onscreen.  It saves it in the file you specify
in the PUNCH statement.  The default if you don't say anything is 'punch.txt'.
NOTE:  As of now, we can't handle binary data on the punch.  This is because
transparent mode receive is broken, I think in the 2703 driver inside 
hercules.  Soon, this will be fixed.
